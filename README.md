## CVEMON - CVE Exploit Monitor

### The Project
At ARPSyndicate, our primary objective is to monitor the web for exploits. Under this project, we aim catalog all the public exploits (including 0-Day, n-Day, etc.) under their respective CVE identifiers (if any).

Both our public & private datasets can be interacted via [ScanFactory India's CVEMON Interface](https://in.scanfactory.io/cvemon.html).

### Community Contributions
All Community contributions should be made in `/community` directory as a JSON Array in respective `CVE-XXXX-XXXX.json`. 


Filename: `/community/CVE-1999-0519.json`
